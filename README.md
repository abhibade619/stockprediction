This project uses a pre-trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict stock prices. Built with Streamlit, it allows users to:
     - Analyze historical stock data fetched from Yahoo Finance.
     - Visualize key trends using Moving Averages (MA_10 and MA_20).
     - Predict future prices for the next 30 business days.

The application is interactive, user-friendly, and offers dynamic stock ticker and date range selection. It showcases actual vs predicted prices and provides intuitive visualizations for better decision-making.
